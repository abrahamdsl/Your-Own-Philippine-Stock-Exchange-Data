* Retrieve Stocks Module

I don't know how to configure this in Windows, but a hint would be, "Scheduled Tasks".. but then
you would need to change certain variables in the program and the line that would be added to cron.

In your Linux box:

You can just run the script and it will write to /tmp/PSE_data/ by default. However, if you want
to have it run automatically every minute during trading hours, do this:

1. Extract script and note the location.
2. Add the following line to your cron file:
   2.1 Execute "crontab -e" (without the quotes, choose whatever editor suits you, nano is recommended)
   2.2  Add the following line, changing  <location of your script> to the appropriate value.
==============add content after here==============
*/1 9-12,13-16 * * 1-5 ( <location of your script>/retrieve_stock_v2.pl ) 2>&1 >> /tmp/retrieve_stock_v2.log
==============add content before here============
   2.3 Save ( if you have chosen nano, press CTRL + O )

The location (  /tmp/PSE_data/ by default ) will be appended with the quotes every minute during trading hours.
